# Problem statement

Create a React application that allows users to input student details, including the student's name and their obtained marks and render those data in a table.

There are two main components, namely the Form component and the Result component. Your task is to complete both of these components.
The application should incorporate a form to collect the name and marks of students.

When the user clicks the button, the student's name and marks should be dynamically inserted into a table, which will be displayed below the student form.
Within the Result component, you should render a table that displays the names and marks of all the students.
It's crucial that the entire page does not reload during this process.
